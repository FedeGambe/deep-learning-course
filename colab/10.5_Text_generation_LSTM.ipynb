Then we are going to convert the seed_textto 50 words by using pad_sequences(). Now we will predict using model.predict_classes(). After that we will search the word in tokenizer using the index in y_predict. Finally we will append the predicted word to seed_text and text and repeat the process."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-rdlcXcLT5pM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1621363510214,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":392,"user":{"displayName":"T3Lab Vision","photoUrl":"","userId":"14779383426442114373"}}},"source":["def generate_text_seq(model, tokenizer, text_seq_length, seed_text, n_words):\n","  text = []\n","\n","  for _ in range(n_words):\n","    encoded = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([seed_text])[0]\n","    encoded = pad_sequences([encoded], maxlen = text_seq_length, truncating='pre')\n","\n","    y_predict = model.predict_classes(encoded)\n","\n","    predicted_word = ''\n","    for word, index in tokenizer.word_index.items():\n","      if index == y_predict:\n","        predicted_word = word\n","        break\n","    seed_text = seed_text + ' ' + predicted_word\n","    text.append(predicted_word)\n","  return ' '.join(text)"],"execution_count":34,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qtYYK9hDb7l-"},"source":["<img src=\"https://frenzy86.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/IFAO/bot.png\" width=\"1200\">"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZVdoQm8XT8SA"},"source":["#We can see that the next 100 words are predicted by the model for the seed_text.\n","text_generated = generate_text_seq(model, tokenizer, seq_length, seed_text, 100)\n","text_generated"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZGTLyhSdqJnP"},"source":["## Text To Speech"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p_ifc_trqSog"},"source":["Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"12H-kSm-Um_Q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1621335183973,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7546,"user":{"displayName":"T3Lab Vision","photoUrl":"","userId":"14779383426442114373"}},"outputId":"6ff9e13c-2568-492a-e980-11dbef7f64a5"},"source":["!pip install gTTS"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting gTTS\n","  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/5f/b9/94e59337107be134b21ce395a29fc0715b707b560108d6797de2d93e1178/gTTS-2.2.2-py3-none-any.whl\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from gTTS) (1.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from gTTS) (2.23.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: click in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from gTTS) (8.0.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: chardet<4,>=3.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->gTTS) (3.0.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3!=1.25.0,!=1.25.1,<1.26,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->gTTS) (1.24.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->gTTS) (2020.12.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<3,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from requests->gTTS) (2.10)\n","Installing collected packages: gTTS\n","Successfully installed gTTS-2.2.2\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cQBDwc1TpzBl"},"source":["from gtts import gTTS\n","from IPython.display import Audio\n","tts = gTTS(text_generated)\n","tts.save('1.wav')\n","sound_file = '1.wav'\n","Audio(sound_file, autoplay=True)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QEFZzk0ypZcA"},"source":["<img src=\"https://frenzy86.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/IFAO/tenor.gif\" width=\"350\">"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wDQgMVcGqDpJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":53},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1621335388543,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5530,"user":{"displayName":"T3Lab Vision","photoUrl":"","userId":"14779383426442114373"}},"outputId":"9c59fab2-f96f-4279-ee3f-9f43849bf71a"},"source":["text = 'be or not to be'\n","\n","text_generated = generate_text_seq(model, tokenizer, seq_length, text, 100)\n","text_generated"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'made to join with simple weeds for the service of a conquered more breaths i have immortal longings in me and be troubled with him and to make me not a patent for a diadem ever as to be won of love and to shift it tell me not seems to you and to be movd already to yaughan wiser to you avoid hor i would you throw it out of the mart parolles ay madam valeria i thank you for idleness the painful sir i am a strumpet i am about you guard things mend you all joy and'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":39}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SQbMzt2jHI_L"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
